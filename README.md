# Don Ferro Visuals
This site is a basic portfolio style site that showcases a set of pictures in a grid. This project served as my final for a server-side scripting class that tested my ability to code PHP and MySQL. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL for this project. The main functionalities created in this project include a login system, account creation and deletion, and a contact form. Once users are logged in, they will recieve a success message and unlock more photos to view.
